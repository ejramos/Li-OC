# Li-OC

This repository contains geochemical/isotopic data and MATLAB files needed to run a zero-dimensional soil formation and Li isotope transfer model, mixing plots, and regressions that are found in Ramos et al., 2024 EPSL.

Soil formation model file: OC_rock_clay_Li_nondim.m; Bedrock-clay mixing plots: OC_rock_clay_Li_mixing.m; Regressions of OC-Li isotope arrays: OC-Li_regression.m

Any queries about the data or the MATLAB files should be sent to Evan Ramos (evan.j.ramos@rice.edu)
